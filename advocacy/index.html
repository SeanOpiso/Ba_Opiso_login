		<h1>Our Advocacy</h1>
		<p>A Catholic movement intended for the renewal and strengthening of Christian family life. CFC couples have committed themselves to the Lord and to one another so that they may grow in maturity as men and women of God and fulfill their primary vocation of raising families grounded in Christian values, in the service and love of God.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We are Couples for Christ. We are committed to live in God’s righteousness and holiness, evangelizing people through a life of love and service. We shall work for the renewal of families that will serve God and build generations of Christian leaders; and we shall pursue Total Christian Liberation through social justice, respect for life, and work with the poor.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Moved by the Holy Spirit, one with the Catholic Church, blessed to witness Christ’s love and service, Couples for Christ is a united global community of family evangelizers that sets the world on fire with the fullness of God’s transforming love.</p>

		<br>
		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>CFC began in 1981 in Manila, Philippines, when Ang Ligaya ng Panginoon (Joy in the Lord), a covenanted Christian charismatic community, realized that to effectively renew society, a conversion of both spouses, and consequently families, to Christ was necessary.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The method used consisted of bringing together a small group of prospective couples in a private home. There they were brought to a living relationship with Jesus Christ and to renewal in the power of the Holy Spirit through a series of weekly informal discussions of the gospel in a social environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Soon, CFC became a Christian family life renewal program made available to parishes and groups of married couples who wished to live out their Christian life in an active supportive relationship with one another. It grows mainly through the establishment of localized units in different parishes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>CFC is recognized by the Vatican as a private institution of the faithful, the decree having first been formally signed in March 2000, and is represented on the Pontifical Council for the Family. On the feast of St. Mark, 25th April 2005, the Vatican through its Pontifical Council for the laity granted definitive approval of the statutes of CFC, thereby confirming permanent recognition of CFC as a private international association of the faithful, with juridical personality, according to canons 298-311 and 321-329 of the Code of Canon Law.</p>
