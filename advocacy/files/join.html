		<h1>Why I Joined</h1>
		<p>The first time that I was exposed to this community was during my early childhood. My parents were members of this community, so it was only natural that I took part in certain activities that were appropriate for my age. I come from a holistic family. Not an overly religious one, but just enough to join conferences and do charity work for the religion. I grew up with strong faith in the religion, and I still carry that faith to this day.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Now that I am a little bit older, I can take part in more interesting activities. We have praisefests, which are essentially just concerts, global days of service, an annual charity event, and just plain old talks and games to bring members of the community together. It's a friendly community, and is actually where I met some of my friends. However, as I progressed through my life, especially during the pandemic, I grew further away. Not from God, but from the community. Just a month ago, I met my friends from the community for the first time in three whole years. I wish to go back and rekindle those friendships and feel like part of the community again.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In the future, if time allows, I would like to properly and officially join one of the ministries for this organization. You see, this organization is separated into six main ministries, each with a different target demographic. One ministry is for kids, another for teenagers, and so on. I want to reconnect with this past life, because I feel like I'm straying away. I sin more. Even the not so religious people have better standings than me. So, to try to rebuild and fortify my moral compass, I'll join a ministry, and so should you.</p>
